# OpenRaster Requirements

Following features should be present: 


## General

* full freely available documentation 
* OpenDocument type of file format (archive with multiple files inside) 
* extensible, but private undocumented extensions should be excluded, any extension should be added to the spec and documentation of the file format 
* applications aren't expected to support all features of the file format, but when manipulating the file they shouldn't lose any information they can't handle 

### Metadata

* storage of metadata using {XMP - Dublin Core - IPTC} tags 
* possibility to store metadata tags per layer 
* storage of EXIF tags 
* all text data in Unicode (UTF-8 or UTF-16) 

### Layers

* storage of multiple layers 
* storage of each layer's coordinates 
* storage of blending (compositing) options for each layer 
* storage of adjustment layers 
* storage of layer effects 
* groups of layers 
* color information - profile, colorspace 

### Other

* storage of paths, clipping paths, text on path 
* selections, masks 
* embedding documents within OpenDocument framework 
* support undo/history of commands/actions like PSD do 

## Challenges

A major problem is that because all features aren't available in all the programs, image won't be displayed the same way in different applications, especially for adjustement/filters layers. And "viewer" apps like inkscape or scribus won't have any implementation at all of those features 

A likely work-around is the optional storage of a redundant extra layer containing the fully rendered pixel data as seen after all image processing, or possibly a lower-resolution snapshot of it suitable for previewing and thumbnailing. 

Different implementations levels might be defined, like, tiny, simple, small, normal, full and custom.
