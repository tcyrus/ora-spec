State: Proposal 


### Undo-history

* OpenRaster file would be able to contain his undo history, like PSD do. This would be useful to continue the editing session in next days or at a later time, without loss anything. 
* Any program which does not support Undo-history OpenRaster files, would simply show the last version of the raster and skip the undo commands history.
