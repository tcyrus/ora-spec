State: Proposal 


### Embed fonts as TTF files

To improve the user experience and maximize the representation accuracy is possible to store the .ttf fonts itself into the .ora file. 

Additionally the implementation must check if the font is libre, then: 

* If is libre: Embed it directly into the .ora 
* If is not libre: Alert the user about the license issues, and offer him to avoid the embeding or to embed it despite of the legal issues.
