State: Proposal  
 Affects: [[../FileLayout|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/FileLayout]] (addenda) 


## Proposal: PNG Data Requirements

The OpenRaster specification should place certain limitations on image data within **.ora** containers in order to ensure that the widest range of applications can open them and display them correctly.  


### General PNG data requirements

Current specification: [[../FileLayout|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/FileLayout]]  
 Change: new section 

Unless otherwise specified for a particular kind of PNG data stream in an OpenRaster file; 

* PNG data _should not_ be interlaced (OpenRaster is not a streaming format) 
* Applications reading OpenRaster data _should_ read and process colour management chunks present in PNG files [[as described in the PNG specification|http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#4Concepts.ColourSpaces]]. 
      * This specification does not place requirements on how applications should _use_ this colour management information internally. 
      * It may however express filters or layer blending modes in terms of particular colour spaces. 
* Applications writing OpenRaster files _should_ write appropriate colour management chunks to each PNG file in the wrapper. 

### Layer data requirements

Current specification: [[../FileLayout#data|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/FileLayout]]  
 Change: addendum 

Stored data files for layers should be encoded in PNG format 


### Thumbnails/thumbnail.png

Current specification: [[../FileLayout#Thumbnails.2BAC8-thumbnail.png|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/FileLayout]]  
 Change: addendum 

Thumbnail images _should_ be encoded in the sRGB colour space. They should be written with an `sRGB` chunk (and the "Perceptual" rendering intent), and with the canonical `cHRM` and `gAMA` chunks and data values for the sRGB encoding colour space.
