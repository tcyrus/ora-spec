### License

a exception which explicit allows for static linking would encourage proprietary usage. KaiUweBehrmann 06:07, 22 January 2010 (UTC) 

   * agreed. I am not all that familiar with licenses (beyond GPL and LGPL) ... do you recommend something like BSD license perhaps? --Lukacu 09:54, 22 January 2010 (UTC) 
         * Yes a BSD-style license would allow this (BSD is very short, just read it...). --Maxy 21:44, 4 February 2010 (UTC) 
               * No problem, I can change the license headers before my next push to the repository --Lukacu 23:57, 4 February 2010 (UTC)
