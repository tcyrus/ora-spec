# Draft OpenRaster Specification

**Version 0.0.5**

## Baseline Intent

Every [[OpenRaster|Specifications/OpenRaster]] file is compliant to Baseline. 

This intent is for exchange between applications and it is allowed to have custom extensions in such a file. 

* [[File Layout Specification|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/FileLayout]]  
* [[Layer Stack Specification|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/LayersStack]] 

## Archival Intent

This intent is for long-term archival and does not allow any application specific extensions. It places additional restrictions on the Baseline Intent. 

* Still under discussion. 

## Extensions / Modules

This describes optional features that are not part of baseline. Extensions should have published working code, and be supported in more than one OpenRaster-aware application. 

* [[Layer Selection Status|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/LayerSelectionStatus]] - load and save layer selection state 
* [[Layer Edit Locking Status|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/LayerEditLockingStatus]] - load & save layer immutability state 

## Proposals and Application Specific Extensions

Those might move to the Extensions after discussion. Application developers are invited to create a wiki entry here and develop it. At some point it might be proposed for inclusion to the Extensions through the Create mailing list. 

* [[Effects Specification|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/EffectsSpecification]] 
* [[Palette|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/Palette]] 
* [[Embed Fonts|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/EmbedFonts]] (Proposal to extension) 
* [[Multiple pages|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/MultiplePages]] 
* [[Animation|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/Animation]] support using multiple pages and a timer like PSD do 
* [[Undo-history|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/UndoHistory]] support undo/history of commands/actions like PSD do 
* [[PNG data requirements|Specifications/OpenRaster/Draft/PngDataRequirements]]
